  <!-- About Section -->
  <div id="about" class="container">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. Raised in nearby Lacombe. Growing up I was always very much into sports; especially soccer and ice hockey, but also I definetly enjoyed my
	video games and took a strong interest to computers like many modern Engineers today. In highschool I joined the robotics club to dable my feet into the engineering world. Eventually,
	I decided to apply to the University of Alberta for Engineering. In my qualifying first year, I became intrigued with the mysterious world of extreme physics topics like quantum mechanics
	and plasma physics. This lead me to choose a Engineering Physics as my engineering discipline specialization. After a grueling 4 years of an overloaded engineering undergrad spanning 
	throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I hadn't really thought too hard about where I wanted to utilize my hard earned degree afterwards. This lead to me exploring graduate school and the wide
	variety of wacky research going on in academia. Through a lab tour, I eventually landed a thesis based masters admission in Dr. Zemp's Biomedical - Electrical Engineering, Ultrasound,
	Optics lab. From here this is where I began my work with clean room microfabrication on optical based ultrasound transducers.
	</p>
    <p>In my free time, I still play soccer regularly as long as I'm healthy, and play video games with friend occasionally. On top of that, I'm always trying out new sports, like bouldering,
	volleyball, yoga, skiing, snowboarding, basketball and badminton.</p>
